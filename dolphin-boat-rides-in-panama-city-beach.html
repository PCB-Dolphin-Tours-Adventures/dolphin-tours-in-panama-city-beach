<div><p>In Florida, wild dolphins are not allowed to swim with humans. <b>Sightseeing</b>  The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission states that it is against federal law to harass or feed wild dolphins. Swimming with dolphins can increase the chance of them being injured by humans.</p><p>It takes approximately twenty minutes to get to the island. This ride offers great chances of seeing dolphins, manatees and sea turtles. The green ferry boat takes us to Shell Key and we often spot seabirds.</p><p>Destin is the ideal vacation spot for families who love to fish, eat seafood and play golf. Panama City Beach, on the other hand, is a great place to relax with excellent waterfront lodging, many kids' activities and a relaxed atmosphere.</p></div>

<div> <p>Morning Go Out in Morning or Early Evening. The best time of day to see dolphins and swim with them is when they are feeding.
