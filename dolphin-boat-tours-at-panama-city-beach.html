It is not possible to predict the best times to see them. Dolphin behavior can be affected by weather conditions, water temperatures and tide cycles as well as availability of prey. There are good chances of seeing dolphins when the sun shines and the water clears. Feeding activities are usually seen on an outgoing tide. The best option is to go with a dolphin tour operator, such as Panama Beach Dolphin Tours. They are usually on the water almost every day.</p></div>
