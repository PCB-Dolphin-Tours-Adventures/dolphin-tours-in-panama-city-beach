<div> <p>You may have seen captive dolphins in a marine park, but it is far more interesting to watch these beautiful animals when they are healthy and free, at home in their natural environment. And even though the behavior of wild dolphins cannot be predicted and a sighting on every trip is not guaranteed, our tour captains have years of experience being on the waters of St. Andrew Bay nearly every day. They know the places where dolphins are most likely to be found and our captains do their best to make sure guests have a great time. On most tours, dolphins are spotted jumping, playing, searching for food, and communicating with one another.</p><p>California, USA.
