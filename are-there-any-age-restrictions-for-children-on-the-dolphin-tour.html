dolphins aggressive to humans?",
"Keywords": ["Panama City Beach Dolphin Tours"],
"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Dolphinaria might have you believe that dolphins are not apex predators of the ocean. They can kill sharks and should be treated accordingly. The aggressive nature of dolphins can make them dangerous to humans, other dolphins and even cause self-harm. The majority of dolphins found in the United States are kept in captivity. However, they are not domesticated."
