<p>Sea water is an effective disinfectant but interaction with wild dolphins could lead to disease transmission. These can pose serious health risks to both dolphins and humans. Swimming with dolphins is considered harassment and you don't want to be fined.</p><p>While dolphins can seem curious, they are often mistakenly interpreted as friendly when in reality, their behavior is a sign of aggression or disturbance. Do not approach, chase, or interact with dolphins in the water. Take immediate action to get away.<br><br><h2>Panama City Beach dolphin safari - Soothing</h2><ul><li>Boats</li><li>Excursion</li><li>Eco-tourism</li><li>Humidity</li><li>Entertainment</li><li>Sunshine</li><li>Captain</li><li>Swim</li><li>Excitement</li><li>Skill</li><li>Delight</li></ul> 28 September 2021</p><p>The above dolphin was very friendly with a tourist at Varadero, Cuba.

<div> <p>Dolphins can be gentle but they can also get angry. If they get mad, they will make a loud, clapping sound with their jaws. They may also slap water hard with the tails. Dolphins can be very helpful.</p><p>A dolphin tour is a top activity in PCB. Pick from one of many local outfitters, and you'll be on your way to a daytime or night sightseeing tour. You will explore St. Andrews Bay as well as the clear waters around Shell Island. It doesn't mean you have to stay on the watercraft. You can add snorkeling to your itinerary for the ultimate Gulf Coast experience.</p><p>The dolphins of St. Andrew Bay are wild animals, so it is impossible to predict the best time to see them. Dolphin behavior is influenced by the season, weather conditions, water temperatures, tide cycles, and availability of prey among many other factors. Generally, there is a good chance of seeing dolphins any time the sun is out and the water is calm and clear. Feeding activities are normally seen on an outgoing tide. Your best bet is to choose a dolphin tour operator like Panama Beach Dolphin Tours that is on the water nearly every day of the year.</p> <i>Compass</i></div>
